# Zerynth App

The Zerynth App is a ready to use mobile app that acts as an interface for all the Zerynth powered objects and permits to turn any mobile into the controller and display for smart objects and IoT systems.

Thanks to the Zerynth App, a bidirectional communication channel between the Zerynth script and the user mobile is enabled and with HTML 5 templates edited directly in Zerynth Studio and embedded in the bytecode, there is no need to develop the application in Android or iOS code.
