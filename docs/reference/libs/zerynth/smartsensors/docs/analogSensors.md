# Analog Sensor Library

This module contains class definitions for analog sensors. AnalogSensor class is a subclass of the generic Sensor class and provides a simple way to handle sensors sensing quantities that can assume more than two different values. Every AnalogSensor instance inherits the whole set of methods from generic Sensor class.

## AnalogSensor class

##### class AnalogSensor

```#!py3 class AnalogSensor(pin)```

This is the class for sensing analog quantities.

Pin can be both a real device pin and a tuple containing an analog sensor object and a string for a window parameter to read.

Example:

```py
lightSensor = AnalogSensor(A4)
sensorOnAverage = AnalogSensor((lightSensor,'currentAverage'))
```

The code above, instantiates a light sensor on a device pin and another sensor that takes as input the lightSensor average.
