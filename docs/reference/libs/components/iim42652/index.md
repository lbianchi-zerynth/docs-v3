This module contains the I2C driver for IIM-42652 6-axis SmartIndustrial™ MotionTracking device that supports an extended operating temperature range. The IIM-42652 combines a 3-axis gyroscope (up to ±2000 degrees/sec), and a 3-axis accelerometer (up to ±16g) and features a 2K-byte FIFO that can lower the traffic on the serial bus interface and reduce power consumption by allowing the system processor to burst read sensor data and then go into a low-power mode.
