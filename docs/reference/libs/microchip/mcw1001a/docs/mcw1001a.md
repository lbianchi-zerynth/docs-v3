# MCW1001A Module

This Zerynth module currently supports multiple concurrent udp and tcp sockets both in client and server mode ([datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/70671A.pdf)).

No select support is provided. No DNS service.
For WIFI security, only WPA2 is currently supported.

Usage example:

```python
import streams
from wireless import wifi
from microchip.mcw1001a import mcw1001a

streams.serial()

# connect to a wifi network
try:
    mcw1001a.init(SERIAL1,D16) # specify which serial port will be used and which RST pin

    print("Establishing Link...")
    wifi.link("Network SSID",wifi.WIFI_WPA2,"Password")
    print("Ok!")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```
