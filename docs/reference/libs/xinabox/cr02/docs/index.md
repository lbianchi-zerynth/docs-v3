# XinaBox CR02-LoRaWAN

The [CR02 xChip](https://wiki.xinabox.cc/CR02_-_LoRa_with_ATmega328P_Core) forms part of the core radio modules and features an ATmega328P CPU running at 16 MHz for handling system and radio operations. The on-board RFM95W LoRaTM module provides ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and high interference immunity whilst minimizing current consumption.

CR02 is utilized as an I2C slave device using LoRaWAN to connect to [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) over the 868MHz range.

Please note, CR02 and all other xChips is currently only supported in Zerynth Studio with [XinaBox CW02](/latest/reference/boards/xinabox_esp32/docs/). Review the [Quick Start](https://wiki.xinabox.cc/Quick-Start) guide for interfacing xChips.
