# LIST2HH12

The LIS2HH12 is an 3-axis linear accelerometer belonging to the “pico” family.

The LIS2HH12 has full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g and is capable of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 10 Hz to 800 Hz. The self-test capability allows the user to check the functioning of the sensor in the final application. The LIS2HH12 has an integrated first-in, first-out (FIFO) buffer allowing the user to store data in order to limit intervention by the host processor. The LIS2HH12 is available in a small thin plastic land grid array package (LGA) and it is guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C
