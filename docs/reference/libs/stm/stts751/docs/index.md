# STM STTS751

The STTS751 is a digital temperature sensor which communicates over a 2-wire SMBus 2.0 compatible bus. The temperature is measured with a user-configurable resolution between 9 and 12 bits. At 9 bits, the smallest step size is 0.5 °C, and at 12 bits, it is 0.0625 °C. At the default resolution (10 bits, 0.25 °C/LSB), the conversion time is nominally 21 milliseconds.

The open-drain EVENT output is used to indicate an alarm condition in which the measured temperature has exceeded the user-programmed high limit or fallen below the low limit. When the EVENT pin is asserted, the host can respond using the SMBus Alert Response Address (ARA) protocol to which the STTS751 will respond by sending its slave address.

The STTS751 is a 6-pin device that supports user-configurable slave addresses. Via the pull-up resistor on the Addr/Therm pin, one of four different slave addresses can be specified. Two order numbers (STTS751-0 and STTS751-1) provide two different sets of slave addresses bringing the total available to eight. Thus, up to eight devices can share the same 2-wire SMBus without ambiguity, thereby allowing monitoring of multiple temperature zones in an application.

The two-wire interface can support transfer rates up to 400 kHz.; more information at [STMicroelectronics dedicated page](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/stts751.html).
