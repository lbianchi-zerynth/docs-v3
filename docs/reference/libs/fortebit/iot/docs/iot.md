# Fortebit IoT Library

The Zerynth Fortebit IoT Library can be used to ease the connection to the [Fortebit IoT Cloud](https://fortebit.tech/cloud/).

It makes your device act as a Fortebit IoT Device that can be monitored and controlled on the Fortebit IoT Cloud dashboard.

The device always send and receive data in the JSON format.

## The Device class

##### class  Device

```#!py3 class  Device(device_token,client,ctx=None)```

Create a Device instance representing a Fortebit IoT device.

The device is provisioned by the `device_token`, obtained from the Fortebit dashboard upon the creation of a new device. The `client` parameter is a class that provides the implementation of the low level details for the connection. It can be one of `MqttClient` in the `mqtt_client` module, or `HttpClient` in the `http_client` module.
The optional `ctx` parameter is an initialized secure socket context.

###### Device.listen_rpc

```#!py3 listen_rpc(callback)```

Listen to incoming RPC requests that get reported to the specified `callback` function, called as *callback(id, method, params)*:


* `id` is the request identifier (number)
* `method` is the method identifier of the RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
* `params` is a dictionary containing the RPC method arguments (or parameters)

Call `send_rpc_reply()` to provide the result of the RPC request.

###### Device.connect

```#!py3 connect()```

Setup a connection to the Fortebit Cloud. Return *True* if successful.

###### Device.is_connected

```#!py3 is_connected()```

Returns the status of the connection to the Fortebit Cloud (reconnections are automatic).

###### Device.run

```#!py3 run()```

Starts the device by executing the underlying client loop.

###### Device.publish_telemetry

```#!py3 publish_telemetry(values,ts)```

Publish `values` (dictionary) to the device telemetry, with optional timestamp `ts` (epoch in milliseconds).

Return a boolean, *False* if the message cannot be sent.

###### Device.publish_attributes

```#!py3 publish_attributes(attributes)```

Publish `attributes` (dictionary) to the device *client* attributes.

Return a boolean, *False* if the message cannot be sent.

###### Device.get_attributes

```#!py3 get_attributes(client,shared,timeout)```

Obtain the specified `client` and/or `shared` attributes from the device.

Return a dictionary, *None* if the data could not be received.

###### Device.send_rpc_reply

```#!py3 send_rpc_reply(id,result)```

Publish `result` (dictionary) as a reply to the RPC request with identifier `id`.

Return a boolean, *False* if the message cannot be sent.

###### Device.do_rpc_request

```#!py3 do_rpc_request(method,params,timeout)```

Perform an RPC request with name `method` and arguments `params`, waiting for a reply maximum `timeout` milliseconds (only with MqttClient).

Return the result of the RPC (dictionary), *None* in case of errors.
