# Cypress CapSense Library

This module exposes easy to use functions to handle Cypress CapSense widgets.

!!! note
	At the moment the library is tailored for use with CapSense widgets mounted on the PSoC6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (i.e., two buttons and a slider). Tuning and custom configurations are not supported.

###### init

```#!py3 init()```

Initializes available CapSense widgets.

###### on_btn

```#!py3 on_btn(callback,event=BTN0_RISE)```


**Arguments:**

    

 - **callback** – callback function
 - **event** – event type

Sets a callback to be called in response to a button event.
Available events are:


* `BTN0_RISE`: triggered on button 0 touch
* `BTN0_FALL`: triggered when button 0 press finishes
* `BTN1_RISE`: triggered on button 1 touch
* `BTN1_FALL`: triggered when button 0 press finishes

Callbacks are called without additional parameters.

###### on_slider

```#!py3 on_slider(callback,event=SLIDER_LEAVE)```


**Arguments:**
    

 - **callback** – callback function
 - **event** – event type

Sets a callback to be called in response to a slider event.
Available events are:


* `SLIDER_ENTER`: triggered on slider touch
* `SLIDER_LEAVE`: triggered when slider press event finishes
* `SLIDER_LVLCHNG`: triggered while the slider is pressed, when the slider centroid value changes

Slider callbacks are called with different parameters, as described below:

```python
# SLIDER_ENTER
def enter_callback(start_pos):
    print("centroid value:", start_pos)

# SLIDER_LEAVE
def leave_callback(start_pos, end_pos):
    print("centroid value on enter and leave:", start_pos, end_pos)

# SLIDER_LVLCHNG
def level_callback(cur_pos):
    print("centroid value:", cur_pos)
```

###### get_centroid

```#!py3 get_centroid()```

Gets current slider centroid value.

Returns `None` if the slider is currently not touched.
