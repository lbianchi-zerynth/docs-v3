# Cypress CapSense

CapSense is a Cypress capacitive sensing solution.

Capacitive sensing can be used in a variety of applications and products where conventional mechanical buttons can be replaced with sleek human interfaces to transform the way users interact with electronic systems. These include home appliances, automotive, IoT, and industrial applications.

CapSense supports multiple interfaces (widgets) using both CSX and CSD sensing methods, with robust performance.

## Technical Details


* supports Self-Capacitance (CSD) and Mutual-Capacitance (CSX) sensing methods;
* supports various Widgets, such as Buttons, Matrix Buttons, Sliders, Touchpads, and Proximity Sensors;
* provides ultra-low power consumption and liquid-tolerant capacitive sensing technology.
