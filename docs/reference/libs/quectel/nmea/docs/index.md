# NMEA Module

This module implements a Zerynth driver and parser for a generic NMEA GNSS receiver.

The following functionalities are implemented:


* retrieve the current location fix if present
* retrieve the current UTC time

The driver supports reading NMEA sentences from a serial port only.

Location fixes are obtained by parsing NMEA sentences of type RMC and GGA, and optionally GSA. Obtaining a fix or UTC time are thread safe operations.
