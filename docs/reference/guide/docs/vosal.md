# Operating System Abstraction Layer

The Zerynth VM uses a common API to create and manage threads and synchronization objects. Such API is called VOSAL and abstracts the details of the underlying RTOS, so that it can be changed as needed for performance or licensing reasons.

## Types


**`VThread`**

VThread is defined as a pointer to a region of memory containing a thread representation. In order to be as abstract as possible the actual type of VThread is void*. Values of type VThread must be managed only by calling vosal functions starting with **vosTh**.


**`VSemaphore`**

VSemaphore is defined as a pointer to a region of memory containing a semaphore representation. In order to be as abstract as possible the actual type of VSemaphore is void*. Values of type VSemaphore must be managed only by calling vosal functions starting with **vosSem**.


**`VSysTimer`**

VSysTimer is defined as a pointer to a region of memory containing a rtos timer representation. In order to be as abstract as possible the actual type of VSysTimer is void*. Values of type VSysTimer must be managed only by calling vosal functions starting with **vosTimer**.


**`VMailBox`**

VMailBox is defined as a pointer to a region of memory containing a rtos mailbox representation. In order to be as abstract as possible the actual type of VMailBox is void*. Values of type VMailBox must be managed only by calling vosal function starting with **vosMBox**. Mailboxes are an optional feature and can be disabled when compiling a VM.


**`VFifo`**

VFifo is defined as a pointer to a region of memory containing a rtos fifo. In order to be as abstract as possible the actual type of VFifo is void\*. Values of type VFifo must be managed only by calling vosal function starting with **vosFifo**. Fifos are an optional feature and can be disabled when compiling a VM.

**`typedef void(*vsystimer_fn)(void *)`**

Type of a timer callback function.

## Variables


**`volatile uint32_t_systime_seconds`**

Holds the number of seconds passed since VM startup. It is not guaranteed to be implemented in every architecture or RTOS.


**`volatile uint64_t_systime_millis`**

Holds the number of milliseconds passed since VM startup. It is not guaranteed to be implemented in every architecture or RTOS.


**`volatile uint32_t_systime_frequency`**

Holds the current frequency of the microcontroller in Hz.

## Macros

### Time Macros


**`NANOS`**

Represent the time unit nanoseconds.


**`MICROS`**

Represent the time unit microseconds.


**`MILLIS`**

Represent the time unit milliseconds.


**`SECONDS`**

Represent the time unit seconds.


**`TIME_U(value,unit)`**

Time values in VOSAL are represented as value plus time unit. This macro creates a valid time representation mixing together *value* (max 30 significant bits) with *unit*. Every vosal function expecting a time must be passed the result of TIME_U.


**`GET_TIME_UNIT(time)`**

Extracts the time unit from *time* to *time*.

**`GET_TIME_VALUE(time)`**

Extracts the time value from *time* to *time*.

**`GET_TIME_MICROS(time)`**

Extracts the time value from *time* converting it to microseconds.


**`TIME_IS_ZERO(time)`**

Evaluates to true if *time* is zero in the corresponding time unit.


**`VTIME_IMMEDIATE`**

A unitless time value representing no time at all.


 **`VTIME_INFINITE`**
 
Infinite amount of time, used when an infinite timeout is requested.

### Priority Macros


 **`VOS_PRIO_IDLE`**
 
This priority should not be used with normal threads. Only one thread exists with this priority and it is created at startup.


**`VOS_PRIO_LOWEST`**

Lowest possible thread priority.


**`VOS_PRIO_LOWER`**

This priority is greater than all preceding thread priorities.


**`VOS_PRIO_LOW`**

This priority is greater than all preceding thread priorities.


**`VOS_PRIO_NORMAL`**

This priority is greater than all preceding thread priorities. It is the default priority.


**`VOS_PRIO_HIGH`**

This priority is greater than all preceding thread priorities.


**`VOS_PRIO_HIGHER`**

This priority is greater than all preceding thread priorities.


**`VOS_PRIO_HIGHEST`**

This priority is greater than all preceding thread priorities.

### Thread Status


**`VTHREAD_READY`**

Status of a thread that has been created but not yet run.


**`VTHREAD_RUNNING`**

Status of a thread that is currently running.


**`VTHREAD_INACTIVE`**

Status of a thread that has finished its life cycle.


**`VTHREAD_WAITING`**

Status of a thread that is sleeping waiting for some event to occur.

## Return values


**`VRES_OK`**

If returned, the function execution encountered no problems.


**`VRES_TIMEOUT`**

If returned, the function exited with a timeout condition.


**`VRES_RESET`**

If returned, the function exited with a reset condition.

## System and Thread functions


**`vosSysLock(void)`**

Locks the system, usually by disabling interrupts. Thread scheduling is suspended and the following code is executed atomically. It can not be used inside ISRs.


**`vosSysUnlock(void)`**

Unlocks the system, usually by enabling interrupts. It is used together with `vosSysLock()` to protect small critical sections. It can not be used inside ISRs.


**`vosSysLockIsr(void)`**

Same as `vosSysLock()`, but must be called only inside an ISR.

**`vosSysUnlockIsr(void)`**

Same as `vosSysUnlock()`, but must be called only inside an ISR.


**`vosEnterIsr(void)`**

Must be called when entering an ISR. Depending on the underlyng RTOS and architecture it can be an empty macro.



**`vosExitIsr(void)`**

Must be called when exiting an ISR. Depending on the underlyng RTOS and architecture it can be an empty macro.


**`vos_irq_handler vosInstallHandler(int32_t hpos,vos_irq handler fn)`**

Install a new ISR  *fn*  at index  *hpos*  in the interrupt table. Previous ISR is returned.

The type vos_irq_handler is: `typedef void (*vos_irq_handler)(void)`.


**`void vosSysReset(void)`**

Soft reset the microcontroller.


**`vos_irq_handler vosInstallHandler(uint32_t size,int32_t prio,void *fn,void *arg,void *data)`**

Create a VThread with a free workspace memory of *size* bytes. Actual memory usage is greater than *size* of an amount dependent on the underlying RTOS data structures. *prio* is the starting priority of the thread. The function run inside the thread is *fn* to which a single argument *arg* is passed. Some *data* can be associated to the created thread.

After creation, the thread is not started. A call to `vosThResume()` is necessary to start the execution of *fn*.


**`void vosThDestroy(VThread th)`**

Frees the memory associated to *th*. Thread *th* must be terminated in order to call vosThDestroy, otherwise memory corruption ensues.


**`void vosThSetData(VThread th,void *data)`**

Attaches *data* to *th*.


**`void* vosThGetData(VThread th)`**

Retrieves data attached to *th*.


**`void* vosThGetId(VThread th)`**

Every created thread has a unique 32 bits id. Returns such id.

**`unit32_ vosThGetStatus(VThread th)`**

Returns the status of *th*. Possible return values are all the thread status macros.


**`void vosThSetPriority(int32_t prio)`**

Changes the priority of the current thread. Values for *prio* are all the priority macros.


**`int32_T vosThGetPriority(void)`**

Returns the priority of the current thread.


**`vThread vosThCurrent(void)`**

Returns the current thread.


**`void  vosThSleep(time)`**

Suspend the current thread for an amount of time represented by *time*. *time* must be passed using `TIME_U`. The precision of vosThSleep depends on the priority of other threads with respect t the current one and to the scheduling strategy of the underlying RTOS.


**`void vosThYield()`**

The current thread is suspended and the control is given to the next thread in the scheduling order.


**`void vosThSuspend()`**

The current thread is suspended until the next call to `vosThResume()`. This function must be preceded by a call to `vosSysLock()`. The implementation of vosThSuspend will remove the lock if necessary.


**`vThread vosThResume(VThread th)`**

Resume the thread *th*. *th* must be a thread just created (and never resumed before) or suspended by `vosThSuspend()`.


**`vThread vosThResumeIsr(VThread th)`**

Resume the thread *th*. *th* must be a thread just created (and never resumed before) or suspended by `vosThSuspend()`. It must be used only inside an ISR.

**`int32_t vosSemWaitTimeout(VSemaphore sem,uint32_t  timeout)`**

Wait on semaphore *sem*. If the value of *sem* is zero or less, the thread is suspended for a time equal to *timeout* (passed with `TIME_U`). If the value of *sem* is one or greater, it is decreased by one and the thread is not suspended. Return `VRES_OK` if the timeout is not triggered, `VRES_TIMEOUT` if it is triggered or `VRES_RESET` if `vosSemReset()` is called on *sem*.
