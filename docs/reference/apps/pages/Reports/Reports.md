# Reports App

???+ question "How to obtain the Reports App?"
  	The Reports Application is included in the base package of the _Zerynth Industrial IoT & AI Platform_.

The Reports Application allows the user to create and manage reports based on templates developed with the customer in mind.

The application is divided in two tabs:

* **Single reports**, which shows a list of the reports generated, either periodically or on demand, and allows to download a report.
* **Periodic reports**, which shows a list of the Report Schedulers, entities that periodically generate reports based on a template.

## Single reports

![single_reports_image]

The Single reports tab shows a list of the reports generated, with the following information:

* **Name**;
* **Type**, which can be Smart report for PDF reports, or Data reports for CSV reports;
* **Category**, which can be either periodic or single. It shows if it is a user requested report or an automatically generated one;
* **Template**, which is the template used to generate the report;
* **From** and **To**, which are the start and end dates of the data analysed by the report;
* **Download**, which is a button that allows to download the report.

By clicking on the **Download** button, the user can download the report in PDF or CSV format, depending on the type of report.

## Periodic reports

The Periodic reports are generated by an entity called Report Schedulers. For every new periodic report added, a new scheduler is put in place, which will generate the report only when it's time to.

The Periodic reports tab shows a list of the Report Schedulers, with the following information:

* **Name**;
* **Type**, which can be Smart report for PDF reports, or Data reports for CSV reports;
* **Template**, which is the template used to generate the report;
* **Email**, which is the email address to which the report is sent;
* **Status**, a slider that shows if the scheduler is currently active or not;

## New report

By clicking on the `+ New` button, you can create a new report. You will need to select the category of the report you want to generate. The choice is between a single report, which is generated on demand, and a periodic report, which is generated periodically.
