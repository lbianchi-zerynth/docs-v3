# Maintenance App

???+ question "How to obtain the Maintenance App?"
    The Maintenance Application is included in the base package of the _Zerynth Industrial IoT & AI Platform_.

The Maintenance App allows for monitoring the status of the machinery and for scheduling maintenance operations.

## Overview

![maintenance_image]

For each machine the page displays the following information:

* **Name**: the name of the machine assigned by the user;
* **Asset type**: the type of asset that is being shown, which can be production machine, auxiliary machine or electrical panel;
* **Maintenance condition**: a percentage that shows how far along the machine is in relation to the next maintenance. 
  It is calculated as the minimum between the periodic maintenance condition and the working hour maintenance condition. 
  It can be a value between 0 and 100%, where 100% means that the machine needs to undergo maintenance as soon as possible;
* **Working hours**: the amount of hours worked by the machine since the last maintenance and the working hours target, in relation to the maximum amount of hours that a machine can work before it needs to undergo maintenance;
* **Next maintenance**: the next maintenance date, calculated with the periodic maintenance target;
* **Last maintenance**: the last date and time when the asset has been submitted for maintenance;

The data can be filtered by asset type or by maintenance condition, by clicking on the filter icon on the top right.

For more information, refer to the Filters page.

If your machine doesn't show up in the Maintenance overview, you are yet to set targets for that machine from the Settings.

## New Maintenance interventions

By clicking on the first icon on the right, the application will show a dialog to add a new maintenance intervention.
