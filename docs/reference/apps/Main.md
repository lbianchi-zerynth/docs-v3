# Zerynth Cloud Documentation

## Introduction
The **Zerynth Industrial IoT & AI Platform** is a full stack hardware-software IoT and AI platform to connect any industrial product or machinery and get visibility on the entire factory in a unified way.

**Zerynth Apps** simplify digital transformation for 4.0 factories by streamlining production processes with pre-configured applications, allowing manufacturing companies to operate more efficiently and effectively.

Thanks to dashboards and tools organised by Application (App), it is possible to leverage Zerynth’s technology to:

* Determine current states of health of any industrial assets;
* Monitor the efficiency of a manufacturing process;
* See aggregated as well as punctual information about energy consumption and related costs of both single machinery as well as entire production line or areas;
* Inspect event logs and fault information and drill down into the details of each asset.

According to the specific package purchased, one or more Applications are enabled in the _Zerynth Industrial IoT & AI Platform_ in order to allow end users to monitor real-time  operating states and health of industrial assets, maximise the efficiency and the performance of manufacturing processes, analyse and optmize energy consumption and related costs, minimise downtime, and manage the maintenance status.

The available Applications organised in section and they are organized in the aside menu as shown below:

* **Machine Monitoring**
    * Machine
    * Consumption
    * Maintenance
* **Tools**
    * Device Management
    * Data Management
    * Custom Dashboards
    * Reports
    * Rules
    * Settings

In addition, tools enabling the export of raw data, the integration with 3rd party systems, the monitoring of SIM cards traffic, the management of Zerynth’s devices from remote is also provided as an integral part of any package sold.

This new version of [_Zerynth Industrial IoT & AI Platform_][zerynth_cloud] provides ready-to-use solutions for extracting relevant information from one's machinery using Apps.

Each App allows for monitoring a specific aspect of the machinery, and for each App, the most relevant information has been collected and displayed through standard dashboards.

It is also possible to go beyond preconfigured Apps by getting a tailor-made solution that perfectly fits your unique needs, creating customised dashboards using Grafana tools.

Let's now take a closer look at the contents of the Zerynth Platform and, more in detail, the Machine Monitoring App.
