# Device
A Device is the smallest entity you can find in the ZDM. 
It is represented by the physical IOT device connected with the ZDM via MQTT.

```bash
zdm device create  [OPTIONS]  NAME
```

Options:

*  `--fleet-id ID`: is the fleet id where the device is associated


## Get
Get a single device by `ID`.

```bash
zdm device get ID
```


## List
List all the device.

```bash
zdm device all

```bash
zdm device update   [OPTIONS] ID
```

## Credentials
The command generates a configuration file (zdevice.json) that contains the security settings of the device with `DEVICE_ID`. 
The file must be copied inside a Zerynth projet using the zdm library.

```sh
zdm device credentials [OPTIONS] DEVICE_ID
```


Options:

 * `--endpoint_mode [secure|insecure]` Choose endpoint mode. `secure` (high security) connect with TLS to MQTT broker on port 8883. `insecure` (no security) connect without TLS to MQTT broker at port 1883. Default `secure`.
 * `--credentials [device_token|cloud_token]` Choose device credentials. `device_token` (medium security) the device will generate its own token, `cloud_token` (low security) the device will connect with a token generated by the ZDM. Default `device_token`.
 * `-o, --output TEXT`              Path to save zdevice.json. Default current directory.
