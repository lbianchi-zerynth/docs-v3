# Flash

This module contains class definitions to read and write the MCU internal flash

## The FlashFileStream class

##### class FlashFileStream

```#!py3 class FlashFileStream(start_address, size)```

This class creates an in memory buffer of size ```size``` bytes that is filled with the content
of the internal flash starting from address ```start_address```

Subsequent operations of read and write are performed on the memory buffer. To actually write the memory buffer
to the internal flash a call to flush() is needed.

The memory buffer can also be accessed via bracket notation. The following is valid syntax:

```py
f = flash.FlashFileStream(0x0800000,512)
f[0] = 1
x = f[10:20]
```

###### FlashFileStream.write

```#!py3 write(buf)```

Writes the content of ```buf``` at the current file position, checking for overflow.

###### FlashFileStream.read_int

```#!py3 read_int()```

Read 4 bytes at the current position and return the corresponding 32 bit integer.

###### FlashFileStream.flush

```#!py3 flush()```

Write the memory buffer to flash. It can be VERY slow because the sector(s) of flash interested by the write operation must be erased first.

###### FlashFileStream.close

```#!py3 close()```

Free memory buffer
