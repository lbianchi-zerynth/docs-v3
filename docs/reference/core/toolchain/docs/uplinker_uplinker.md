# Uplink

Once a Zerynth program is compiled to bytecode it can be executed by transferring such bytecode to a running virtual machine on a device.
This operation is called “uplinking” in the ZTC terminology.

Indeed Zerynth virtual machines act as a bootloader waiting a small amount of time after device reset to check if new bytecode is incoming.
If not, they go on executing a previously loaded bytecode or just wait forever.

The command:

```py
ztc uplink alias bytecode
```

will start the uplinking process for the device with alias `alias` using the compiled `.vbo` file given in the `bytecode` argument. As usual `alias` ca be partially specified.

The uplinking process may require user interaction for manual resetting the device whan appropriate. The process consists of:


* a discovery phase: the device with the given alias is searched and its attributes are checked


* a probing phase: depending on the device target a manual reset can be asked to the user. It is needed to reset the virtual machine and put it in a receptive state. In this phase a “probe” is sent to the virtual machine, asking for runtime details


* a handshake phase: once runtime details are known, additional info are exchanged between the linker and the virtual machine to ensure correct bytecode transfer


* a relocation phase: the bytecode is not usually executable as is and some symbols must be resolved against runtime details


* a flashing phase: the relocated bytecode is sent to the virtual machine

Each of the previous phases may fail in different ways and the cause can be determined by inspecting error messages.

The ```uplink``` may the additional `--loop times` option that specifies the number of retries during the discovery phase (each retry lasts one second).

# Uplink (raw)

It is possible to perform an uplink against a configured device by specifying the relevant device parameters as in the register raw command, by specifying the `port` parameter.

The command:

```py
ztc uplink_raw target bytecode --spec port:the_port
```

performs an uplink on the device of type `target` using the bytecode file at `bytecode` using the serial port `port`.

# Uplink by probe

It is possible to perform an uplink against a configured device by using a probe. Contrary to other uplink commands that require a bytecode file argument, the `uplink_by_probe` command requires a linked bytecode file argument (obtained with the link command).

The command:

```py
ztc uplink_by_probe target probe linked_bytecode
```

perform an uplink on the device type `target` using probe `probe` to transfer the `linked_bytecode` file to the running VM.
It is possible to change the address where the bytecode will be flashed by specifying the `--address` option followed by the hexadecimal representation of the address (useful for OTA VMs scenarios)

# Link

The command:

```py
ztc link vmuid bytecode
```

generates a file containing the bytecode `bytecode` modified in such a way that it can be executed on the VM `vmuid` without the need for an uplink.

This command is mainly used to generate executable bytecode for FOTA updates. Alternatively it can be used to generate a binary firmware to be manually flashed on a device, skipping both device recognition and uplinking.

It takes the following options:


* `--vm n`, for FOTA enabled VMs, generate a bytecode that can be executed by a VM running on slot `n`. Default `n` is zero.


* `--bc n`, for FOTA enabled VMs, generate a bytecode that can be executed by on bytecode slot `n`. Default `n` is zero.


* `--include_vm`, generate a single binary containing both the VM and the bytecode, ready to be flashed on the device. Not compatible with FOTA VMs!


* `--otavm`, generate both bytecode and VM ready for a FOTA update


* `--file file`, save the output to file `file`

## FOTA updates

Generating firmware for FOTA updates can be tricky. The following information is needed:


* The VM unique identifier, `vmuid`


* The unique identifier of a new FOTA enabled VM, `vmuid_new`


* The current slot the VM is running on, `vmslot`. Can be retrieved with fota library


* The current slot the bytecode is running on, `bcslot`, Can be retrieved with fota library

For example, assuming a project has been compiled to the bytecode file `project.vbo` and `vmslot=0` and `bcslot=0`, the following commands can be given:

```py
# generate bytecode capable of running on slot 1 with VM in slot 0
# the resulting file can be used for a FOTA update of the bytecode
ztc link vmuid project.vbo --bc 1 --file project.vbe

# generate bytecode capable of running on slot 1 with VM in slot 1
# the resulting file CAN'T be used for a FOTA update because the running VM is in slot 0
# and project.vbe does not contain the new VM
ztc link vmuid_new project.vbo --bc 1 --vm 1 --file project.vbe

# generate bytecode capable of running on slot 1 with VM in slot 1
# the resulting file can be used for a FOTA update of the bytecode and VM
# because project.vbe contains the new VM
ztc link vmuid_new project.vbo --bc 1 --vm 1 --otavm --file project.vbe
```

!!! note
	It is not possible to generate a FOTA update of the VM only!

!!! note
	To generate a Zerynth ADM compatible FOTA bytecode update, add option `-J` before the link command. The resulting file will be JSON and not binary.
