# DAC

This module loads the DAC (Digital Analog Converter) interface.
A digital to analog converter is a module to convert digital values into analog ones.

While builtin analogWrite ```simulates``` an analog value through the PWM peripheral, DAC output is a pure analog one.
This means higher accuracy, specially with high speed signals.

Example:

```py
import streams
import adc # for analogRead

import dac


def readInput():
    while True:
        print("reading A1: ",analogRead(A1))
        sleep(500)

streams.serial()
pinMode(A1,INPUT)
# read input in a separate thread
thread(readInput)

my_dac = dac.DAC(D8.DAC)
my_dac.start()

my_dac.write([100,200,900,800],1000,MILLIS,circular=True)
```

## The DAC class

##### class DAC

```#!py3 class DAC(pin)```

Creates a DAC instance on ```pin``` pin (look at board pinmap to see which pins are enabled for using the DAC peripheral).

###### DAC.start

```#!py3 start()```

DAC is started. It is necessary to start the driver before writing any value.

###### DAC.write

```#!py3 write(data, timestep, timeunit, circular=False)```

```data``` is output on selected pin.

```data``` parameter can be:
* a single integer value:

```py
my_dac.write(666)
```


* a list of values to be output every ```timestep``` *timeunit\*econds until the end of the list is reached and last value is kept on output:

```py
my_dac.write([555,666,777],500,MILLIS)
# one sample every 500 MILLISeconds
```


* a list of values to be output every ```timestep``` timeunit*econds, restarting from the beginning as soon as the end of the list is reached, until write method is called again:

```py
my_dac.write([555,666,777],500,MILLIS,circular=True)
```

###### DAC.stop

```#!py3 stop()```

dac is stopped and low level configuration disabled.

###### DAC.lock

```#!py3 lock()```

Locks the driver. It is useful when the same dac object is used by multiple threads to avoid interferences.

###### DAC.unlock

```#!py3 unlock()```

Unlocks the driver. It is useful when the same dac object is used by multiple threads to avoid interferences.

###### DAC.remap

```#!py3 remap(values, lowflex=660, highflex=3415)```

Some DAC chips have a limited voltage range (i.e. Sam3X by Atmel maps from ~3.3/6 V to ~3.3\*(5/6) V) and remap given output values according to their operative ranges.
This helper function allows the user to obtain the voltage value he would expect from a proportional DAC.

Given a ```value``` in ```values``` list, DAC output will respect the following formula:

```py
output_voltage = board_voltage * (value/4096)
```

Each ```value``` in the list must be an integer between ```lowflex``` and ```highflex``` in order to avoid a TypeError exception.

```lowflex``` and ```highflex``` default values are set to the correct values for Sam3X mcu.
