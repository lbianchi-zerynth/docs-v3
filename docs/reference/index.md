Each board is supported with a [board support package](libs/expansions/) that automatically configures the hardware and imports the appropriate libraries.

### Firmware

Zerynth OS was designed to enable efficient and short development time. It handles all development layers from hardware configuration till secure cloud communication. 
Zerynth SDK provides different ways for firmware development, It supports [VSCode through the extension ](vscode/index.md) and the [command line interface](cli/ztc/index.md).

### Cloud

Zerynth Cloud is a complete platform that frees you from the burden of maintaining all the technology and infrastructure of developing and deploying fleets of devices, while focusing on the added value of IoT data. From a single interface, provision and manage IoT devices, store and visualize data, and gain valuable insights and issue firmware updates on fleets of devices.
For more information, Check the [device manager documentation](libs/zerynth/zdm/) and [device manager APIs.](api/zdm/)
