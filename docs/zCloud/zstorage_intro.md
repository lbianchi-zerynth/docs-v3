# **Introduction to zStorage**

The zStorage is the storage solution that integrates perfectly with all the other components of the zCloud.

When zDeviceManager receives data from your devices, with a simple configuration it can store them in a dedicated database managed by the zStorage. You have easy access to the data via REST APIs and batch jobs.
