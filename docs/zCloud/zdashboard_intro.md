# Introduction to zDashboard

The zDashboard is the data visualization solution that integrates perfectly with all the other components on the zCloud.

While the zDeviceManager receives data from your devices and the zStorage keeps them safely in an optimized database, the zDashboard helps you visualizing them in powerful dashboards. You can easily edit the dashboards and give your users access to them.
