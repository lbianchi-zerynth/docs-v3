# **Introduction to Zerynth Dashboard**

The Zerynth Dashboard is the data visualization solution that integrates perfectly with all the other components on the Zerynth Cloud.

While the Zerynth Device Manager receives data from your devices and the Zerynth Storage keeps them safely in an optimized database, the Zerynth Dashboard helps you visualizing them in powerful dashboards. You can easily edit the dashboards and give your users access to them.
