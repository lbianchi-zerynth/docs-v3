# **4ZeroBox Mobile**

The 4ZeroBox Mobile is an Industrial data acquisition device that features Cellular 2G, NB-IOT and Wi-Fi connectivity and GPS Capabilities. There are many onboard features like: a DIN-rail mountable case,  industrial grade sensor channels, support for Wi-Fi, Relays, support for CAN protocols, RS485, RS232 interfaces.
The 4ZeroBox Mobile can be integrated with any of Zerynth expansion boards. They can act as a prototype during the development stage, and a core for industrial applications.

## **Getting Started**

For step-by-step guide on connecting, running your first example, Please refer to [the Getting started guide for the 4ZeroBox Mobile](../../gettingstarted/4ZeroBox_mobile/)

## **Software Library**

For more information on the 4ZeroBox mobile software Library, Its features, functions and examples demos
[Please check this Link](../../reference/libs/expansions/)


## **Power**

Power to the 4ZeroBox mobile is supplied via the on-board USB Micro B connector or directly via the  9V-36V pins on the P1 connector. The power source is selected automatically. Zerynth 4ZeroBox Mobile has also a JST Li-Po battery connector (3.7V).

## **zBus**

The zBus is an efficient, powerful standard for connecting and prototyping different sensors and devices.
The zBus is using the CN1 pin header (20x2) exposing the following:

* 16 GPIO pins.
* 4 interrupt pins.
* 2 USART/UART instances with full support (TX,RX,RTS,CTS)
* I2C, SPI support.
* 5V, 3.3 V output pins.
* Enable pin for controlling the power to attached expansion boards.


The zBus allows the connection in a cascade of different add-on modules to create specific industrial applications that fit into a DIN-RAIL case.

The development board offers a modular expansion system that adds expansion boards through the connectors on the board (zbus).
Expansion boards vary in features and functionalities. Currently, Zerynth offers expansion boards for :
