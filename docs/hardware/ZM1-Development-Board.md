# **ZM1-DB**

The ZM1 Development board is an industrial-oriented, modular hardware development unit, Facilitates the development of scalable, secure and connected IoT applications.

The ZM1-DB mounts [the ZM1 module](ZM1_module.md), a 32-bit dual Core MCU. The ZM1 Core features a clock frequency of up to 240 Mhz, Embedded SPI Flash memory of 16 MB, integrates the crypto element ATECC608A for ultra-secure communication.

The ZM1 Development Board can act as a Development Board for prototyping a Product, and a core for industrial applications, thanks to the expansion modules system.
The DB features I/O connectors (the Z-bus) that allow the connection in a cascade of different add-on modules to create specific industrial applications that fit into a DIN-RAIL case.

## **Power**

The development board can be powered through the USB type-C connection, 9-36V Power Supply connector P1.
DC power supply has priority over the USB power supply, but the power circuit automatically detects and uses the available power source.
## **Ethernet**

The ZM1-DB supports Ethernet connection, The board uses the RJ45 Connector and LAN8710 as a physical layer transceiver.
For the Ethernet software driver and Examples,[Please refer to the Ethernet](../../reference/libs/networking/eth/#ethernet)

## **SD Card**

The board features an on-board SD Card interface,For more information [please refer to the Filesystem module](../../reference/libs/stdlib/fs/)


## **Z-Bus**

The modular expansion system uses the Z-Bus. The Z-Bus is an efficient, powerful standard for connecting and prototyping different sensors and devices.
The Z-Bus is using the CN1 pin header (20x2) exposing the following:

* 16 GPIO pins.
* 4 interrupt pins.
* 2 USART/UART instances with full support (TX,RX,RTS,CTS)
* I2C, SPI support.
* 5V, 3.3 V output pins.
* Enable pin for controlling the power to attached expansion boards.

!!! note 
    The development boards support up to 3 attached expansion boards.

The Z-Bus allows the connection in a cascade of different add-on modules to create specific industrial applications that fit into a DIN-RAIL case.

The development board offers a modular expansion system that adds expansion boards through the connectors on the board (Z-bus).
Expansion boards vary in features and functionalities. Currently, Zerynth offers expansion boards for :
