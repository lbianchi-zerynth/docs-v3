# **EXP-CONNECT**

The EXP-CONNECT expansion board Adds GPS and GSM/NB-IoT capabilities to your
application. It enables you to monitor and locate your assets, ensuring visibility of their
position and allowing you to receive real time notifications on critical events.

Zerynth expansion boards work seamlessly with all of the Zerynth Development boards.
Combined, they can act as a Development Boards for prototyping a Product, and a core
for industrial applications.

## **Rotary and Standard switches**

For information on the switches and other hardware details, Please refer to the [User manual of the board](#resources-and-documents)

## **Power**

Power to the EXP-CONNECT is supplied directly by the ZM1-DB.

!!! warning
    The EXP-CONNECT works only if the ZM1-DB is powered with 24VDC from the external screws.

## **Z-Bus**

The modular expansion system uses the Z-Bus. The Z-Bus is an efficient, powerful standard for connecting and prototyping different sensors and devices.
The Z-Bus is using the CN1 pin header (20x2) exposing the following:

* 16 GPIO pins.
* 4 interrupt pins.
* 2 USART/UART instances with full support (TX,RX,RTS,CTS)
* I2C, SPI support.
* 5V, 3.3 V output pins.
* Enable pin for controlling the power to attached expansion boards.

!!! note 
    The development boards support up to 3 attached expansion boards.
