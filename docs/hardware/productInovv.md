# **Product Innovation Kit**

The Product Innovation Kit gives developers all of the necessary components to develop innovative and scalable IoT products. 

The kit is driven by the powerful ZM1-Development board, The ZM1-DB is an industrially oriented, modular hardware development unit that facilitates the development of scalable, secure and connected IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

The ZM1-DB and the expansion boards can act as a Development Board for prototyping a product and as a core for industrial applications with the modular expansion system.
The DB features I/O connectors (the zBUS) that allow connection in a cascade of different add-on modules to create specific industrial applications that fit into a DIN-RAIL case.

## **Typical Applications**

Various applications can be made with the kit. When EXP-PROTO is introduced the number of possibilities is infinite along side the features of every expansion board, it features the EXP-Proto that enables developers to connect any Module, IC, display or device to the circuit and connect them to the zBus.
Some of the most common applications might be:
* Remote motor/Pump controller
* Wifi/Ethernet Thermostat
* CAN/RS485/RS232 to WiFi/Ethernet gateway
* House automation controller
* Visualize Industrial processes.
